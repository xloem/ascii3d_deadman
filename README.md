# ascii3d_deadman

This is an attempt to make a small ascii 3D graphics engine in python.

It was inspired by an ascii rendering of myself hanging that I wrote in a dissociated state of mind at https://lists.cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2022-June/101485.html .

I often struggle to do algorithmic work, but really wanted to get into it when young. It's usually pleasant for me when I find states of mind where I can pursue algorithmic projects.
